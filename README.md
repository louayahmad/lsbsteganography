# lsbsteganography

Trained a deep neural network to correctly classify images of dogs, cats, cars, and humans allowing the user to input any images and receive the best classification

Constructed an algorithm that attacks the neural network by inserting messages and malicious text into the images using Least Significant Bit Steganography and also misclassifies the images after being trained on the network
